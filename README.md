# fashion_classification

This code is a basic implementation of a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

Importing Libraries: The code imports the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Loading Data: The code loads the Fashion MNIST dataset using keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data().

Data Preprocessing: The code extracts a single image from the training set and prints its label. It also prints the shapes of the training and testing datasets.

Model Definition: The code defines a sequential neural network model with three dense layers:

The first layer flattens the input data (28x28 images) into a 1D array.

The second and third layers have 300 and 100 neurons, respectively, with ReLU activation.

The final layer has 10 neurons (one for each class) with softmax activation.

Model Compilation: The code compiles the model with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, and accuracy as a metric.

Data Split: The code splits the training data into training and validation sets (5000 samples for validation).

Model Training: The code trains the model on the training set for 30 epochs with validation on the validation set.

Prediction: The code makes predictions on the first 5 samples of the testing set.

Class Label Extraction: The code extracts the class labels from the predictions using np.argmax().

In summary, this code trains a simple neural network to classify Fashion MNIST images and makes predictions on a small subset of the testing data
